## General Information
- This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes in a city.
- The business problem addressed is understanding and forecasting bike demand to optimize bike availability and reduce wait times for users.
- The dataset used contains various features such as date, season, weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the number of bikes rented per hour.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- pandas - version 1.2.4
- numpy - version 1.19.2
- scikit-learn - version 0.24.1
- matplotlib - version 3.3.4
- seaborn - version 0.11.1

## Conclusions
- The model identified key features impacting bike demand.
- Weather conditions significantly affect the demand for bikes.
- Seasonal variations and temperature also play a crucial role.
- The model's predictions can help in effective bike-sharing system management.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to optimize bike-sharing systems in urban areas.
- Dataset provided by [Upgrade].
- This project was based on (https://learn.upgrad.com/).
